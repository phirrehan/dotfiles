# given as argument for the script. This script ignores stdin if both argument and
# stdin are provided.

# The purpose of this script is not to provide a clipboard but rather unify
# different enviornments' clipboard.
# Note: If using with termux, you need to install termux-api package from F-droid.

# Set CPY_CMD or copy command variable according to enviornment. Replace
# wl-copy with the clipboard utility for your desktop. wl-copy is used for wayland.
